HINTS

Prefetch - For each input tensor for a kernel, find that kernel ID and assign a prefetch hint for that tensor at kernel_id - 1

Preallocate - For each output tensor kernel, find that kernel ID and assign a preallocate hint for that tensor at kernel_id - 1

Preeviction - For each tensor, assign a preeviction hint at end of its live interval

Results (so far, using VIT-1024)
    Prefetch + Preallocate + Preeviction - stalls out, idk why
    Prefetch + Preallocate - barely worse than without HINTS
    Prefetch - barely better than without HINTS

VIT and INCEPTION are the only ones with performance improvements, the rest they are the same

Moving forward, will be testing the rest of the suite with only Prefetching, prob should do the same for replacement policy
